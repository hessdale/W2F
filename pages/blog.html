        <h3>Modern day socialism</h3>
    </header>
    <p>Modern day socialism offers a solution to the unequal distribution of wealth and resources in our current
        economic system. By implementing policies that prioritize the needs of the community as a whole, such as
        guaranteeing access to healthcare and education, as well as supporting worker-owned cooperatives, modern day
        socialism seeks to create a more equitable society. The idea is to shift the power dynamic away from
        corporations and towards the people, allowing for a more democratic control over the economy. With a focus on
        social welfare and the collective good, modern day socialism has the potential to address the systemic issues
        that have plagued capitalism, and create a sustainable and just economy for all.</p>
